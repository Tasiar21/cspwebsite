	<h3> This is an interactive code which takes the user through a lesson of how to make either a California roll or a Salmon roll. The user will be prompted to type each ingredient according to the order given, they will also be able to roll and cut the sushi into how many pieces they would like. </h3>

      </br>
	<h3> This program uses user input through onkey functions to navigate past the moving colored gifts to reach the end. The user has 3 lives and 30 secoonds to make it past the moving obstacles. The obstacles (gifts) are in a constant loop to move at a constant speed up and down the screen. If the user fails to complete the game in 3 lives, the screen will display "You Died" </h3>
   <h1>   Scratch Project</h1>
	<h2> Space Dog</h2>

	<h3> This is a space themed obstacle course program in which the user is a Space Dog and tries to complete all 9 levels to escape outer space. </h3>
  	<h1> A Phishy Fish Tank</h1>
	    <img src="images/Fishtank.PNG" height="300">
	<h3>We investigated the breach in the code which was attributed to email phishing and corrupted files. We were able to fix the fish tank monitoring system and make it run smoothly. </h3>
    <h1> 2.1.4 Simulation Project </h1>
	    <img src="images/lightningsim.PNG" height="300">
	<h3>We chose a simulation on NetLogo to analyze and draw conclusions about. The lightning strike simulation was impacted by amount of dust present, amount of ions, and number of trees. </h3>
    <h1> 3.1.6 Project </h1>
	 <img src="images/desert.PNG" height="300">	
	<h3> Based on how we categorized our data, we concluded that the rover was sensing light, movement, temperature, and sound from the Desert Plains. Our constructed graphs were the most similar to the data graphs which led us to our findings. We separated and cleaned up the data found to easily visualize consistencies between the potential regions.</h3>
	 <h1> 3.2.4 Project </h1>

	 <img src="images/3.2.4graph1.PNG" height="300">
	<h3> In this project, we gathered and analyzed data about bee population trends and produced graphs to visually understand growths and declines. We porduced graphs showing trends in large, mid, and small honey production rates across the United States.</h3>
